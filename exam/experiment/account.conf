% Sample configuration file
% Add partitions by inserting a new line starting with "partition"
% followed by the partition's wsdl URL
%
% Set the time the proxy should wait before initializing partitions
% with initTime (in milliseconds).
% Set the name of the file containing the init data with initFile.
% Init files are expected to be in the current user's home directory.
% Enable optimistic concurrency control by setting optimistic to true.
% (For this to work, the partitions must be able to access this file as well).
% Separate all tokens by tabs; only one statement per line is allowed.
